** Today's Progress
+ Finished Week one lessions video.
+ Set up Ocaml evironment with Emacs.
+ Write some basic ocaml code.

Ocaml is similar with Standard ML, And has lots of advantage.For example

The key additional ingredients
+ type inference: you don’t need to
write them!
+ pattern-matching: life saving data
manipulation feature!

In 2000 Jacques Garrigue’s extended Objective Label branch with
polymorphic methods, labeled and optional arguments, and polymorphic
variants, and In 2011 the name is definitely changed to Ocaml.
